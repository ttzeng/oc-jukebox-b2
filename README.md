OCF Compliant Android Things Jukebox Demo
=====

This repository contains the source code of the [Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/index.html) based Jukebox demo that consists of a MP3 player and its Android companion app. The MP3 player is designed for running on [Intel Edison Kit for Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified/IntelEdison) with [Grove LCD RGB backlight module](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove/Display/Grove_LCD_RGB_Backlight/) to display the played MP3 titles, it also integrates the [IoTivity base library for Android](https://api-docs.iotivity.org/latest-java/index.html) for being discovered and controlled by the companion app via [OCF](https://openconnectivity.org/) standards. The demo represents the jukebox device as three [standard OC resources](https://openconnectivity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/OIC_1.1_Candidate_Specification.zip) of type Brightness, Colour RGB, and Audio Controls, and a vendor proprietary media player resource for controlling MP3 playback.
